# 0x1D. C - Binary trees

practicing how to implement a Binary Tree Data structure

## Helper Files

* [binary_tree_print.c](./binary_tree_print.c): C function that prints a Binary Tree

## Header File :file_folder:

* [binary_trees.h](./binary_trees.h): header file - contains struct definition for binary tree and function prototypes

## Tests :heavy_check_mark:

[tests](./tests): Folder for all test files

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. New node**
  * [0-binary_tree_node.c](./0-binary_tree_node.c): C function that creates a binary tree node

* **1. Insert left**
  * [1-binary_tree_insert_left.c](./1-binary_tree_insert_left.c): C function that inserts a new node as the left child of another node

* **2. Insert right**
  * [2-binary_tree_insert_right.c](./2-binary_tree_insert_right.c): C function that inserts a new node as the right child of another node

* **3. Delete**
  * [3-binary_tree_delete.c](./3-binary_tree_delete.c): C function that deletes an entire binary tree

* **4. Is Leaf**
  * [4-binary_tree_is_leaf.c](./4-binary_tree_is_leaf.c): C function that checks if a node is a leaf

* **5. Is Root**
  * [5-binary_tree_is_root.c](./5-binary_tree_is_root.c): C function that checks if a given node is a root

* **6. Pre-order traversal**
  * [6-binary_tree_preorder.c](./6-binary_tree_preorder.c): C function that goes through a binary tree using pre-order traversal

* **7. In-order traversal**
  * [7-binary_tree_inorder.c](./7-binary_tree_inorder.c): C function that goes through a binary tree using in-order traversal

* **8. Post-order traversal**
  * [8-binary_tree_postorder.c](./8-binary_tree_postorder.c): C function that goes through a binary tree using post-order traversal

* **9. Height**
  * [9-binary_tree_height.c](./9-binary_tree_height.c): C function that measure the height of a binary tree

* **10. Depth**
  * [10-binary_tree_depth.c](./10-binary_tree_depth.c): C function that measures the depth of a binary tree

* **11. Size**
  * [11-binary_tree_size.c](./11-binary_tree_size.c): C function that calculates the size of binary tree

* **12. Leaves**
 * [12-binary_tree_leaves.c](./12-binary_tree_leaves.c): C function that counts the leaves in a binary tree
