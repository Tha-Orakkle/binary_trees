# 0x1D. C - Binary trees

practicing how to implement a Binary Tree Data structure

## Helper Files

* [binary_tree_print.c](./binary_tree_print.c): C function that prints a Binary Tree

## Header File :file_folder:

* [binary_trees.h](./binary_trees.h): header file - contains struct definition for binary tree and function prototypes

## Tests :heavy_check_mark:

[tests](./tests): Folder for all test files

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. New node**
  * [0-binary_tree_node.c](./0-binary_tree_node.c): C function that creates a binary tree node

* **1. Insert left**
  * [1-binary_tree_insert_left.c](./1-binary_tree_insert_left.c): C function that inserts a new node as the left child of another node
